# Resume Classification & Analysis using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project implements an end-to-end Resume Classification System using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques. The model automatically analyzes raw resume text and classifies it into predefined job categories, helping recruiters and HR systems streamline resume screening and talent shortlisting processes.
The system also allows users to upload their own resume (PDF / DOCX / TXT) and predicts the most suitable job profile based on learned patterns from historical resume data.

## Business Problem
Manual resume screening is time-consuming, inconsistent, and error-prone when dealing with large volumes of applicants. Recruiters need an automated, accurate, and scalable solution to categorize resumes and identify suitable candidates quickly.

## Solution
This project leverages TF-IDF text vectorization and multiple supervised machine learning classifiers to accurately predict resume categories. The best-performing model is automatically selected and used for real-time resume classification.
